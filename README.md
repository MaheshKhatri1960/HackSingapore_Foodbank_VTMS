# HackSingapore_Foodbank_VTMS
Submission for HackSingapore's No Code Low Code Challenge for Foodbank Singapore's Volunteer to Task Management System (VTMS)

Food Bank Singapore (FB SG) Volunteer Task Management System (VTMS)  has two linked web cloud based software modules: Volunteer & Administration.

Volunteer Module allows volunteers to respond to FB SG volunteer tasks available, offer time based services, view FB SG volunteer job roles responsibilities, requirements, browse task related videos and manage their task related data & metrics.

Administration module will enable FB SG to browse volunteer profile & interests, create tasks, approve task applications, automatically send task application receipt & task approval emails. It also stores data relating to volunteer task management - FB SG locations, facilities, work shift timings, restrictions, work areas / functions, job role duties & responsibilities, requirements & qualifications and manage database along with other key stakeholders such as beneficiaries, donors & volunteer groups. This is for both individuals & organisations.
